# wireshark-udpdump

Assorted patches to the udpdump.c external capture program of Wireshark.

Apply the patches to the extcap/udpdump.c file in your copy of the Wireshark source code, compile it, and install it.
Alternatively for Windows, you can just copy the pre-compiled udpdump.exe file into your Wireshark installation directory (usually C:\Program Files\Wireshark\extcap\udpdump.exe).

These files are distributed under the same license as udpdump and Wireshark (the GNU General Public License version 2).
